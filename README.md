* **AppBar Bottom** 
 - Bottom app bars provide access to a bottom navigation drawer and up to four actions, including the floating action button.
 - To support the intent of different sections of an app, the layout and actions of a bottom app bar can be changed to suit each screen.

* **What's New**
1. Fab animation 
2. Circle revel animation
3. Shared animation 
4. Bottom sheet

* **Demo**  
1. Floating Button Animation 

   Upon scroll, the bottom app bar can appear or disappear:

   - Scrolling downward hides the bottom app bar. If a FAB is present, it detaches from the bar and remains on screen.
   - Scrolling upward reveals the bottom app bar, and reattaches to a FAB if one is present.

2. Circle Revel Animation

3. Bottom Sheet 

   - Menus that are generated by the bottom app bar (such as a bottom navigation drawer or overflow menu) open as bottom sheets at a            higher elevation than the bar.
   - This bottom navigation drawer opens from a bottom app bar. The drawer opens in front of the bottom app bar, and displays a top app        bar to close the drawer when it reaches full height.
